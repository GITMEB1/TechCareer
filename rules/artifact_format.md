# Artifact Format (Use every time)

For each mission, output artifacts in this order:

## Artifact A — Plan (5–12 bullets)
- Goal
- Inputs used
- Steps
- Risks + mitigations
- Verification

## Artifact B — Draft/Deliverable
- The actual deliverable (CV bullets, email, repo README, etc.)
- **IMPORTANT:** If executing a workflow (e.g., Application Factory), do NOT print the full file contents here. State "Files generated in workspace" and list the file paths.

## Artifact C — Evidence Log
- VERIFIED: [Link/Screenshot]
- SUPPORTED: [SSOT Reference]
- UNVERIFIED: [Removed/Flagged]
- *If running Application Factory, output the mandatory **Validation JSON** block here.*

## Artifact D — Next Actions (dated)
- Action | Owner | Date | Status
