# AntiGravity Context Pack — Danny Jackson (v1.0)
**Purpose:** Give Google AntiGravity a stable, auditable “mission pack” to help Danny convert overlooked opportunities into consistent income and career stability.

## What this pack is
A set of **rules, schemas, and mission briefs** designed for an **agent-first workflow**:
- The agent produces **Artifacts** (plans, checklists, drafts, evidence tables) you can review.
- Work is broken into small, verifiable missions so you stay in control.

## How to use in AntiGravity
1. **Check the internal task tracker**:
   - Open `task.md` in the root to see current status and next steps.
2. **Run Workflows**:
   - Use the agent to execute workflows found in `.agent/workflows/`.
   - Example: "Run the Opportunity Radar workflow."
3. **Review Artifacts**:
   - Results are saved in `tracking/` or `applications/`.

## Ground rules
- **No invented metrics.** If a number isn’t evidenced, the agent must mark it as “UNVERIFIED”.
- **No irreversible commands.** The agent must never run destructive terminal commands without explicit confirmation.

## Key files
- `rules/agent_operating_rules.md` — the master behavioral contract
- `rules/safety_guardrails.md` — hard safety constraints (terminal/file operations)
- `schemas/opportunity.yaml` — the schema for capturing opportunities
- `missions/` — step-by-step mission briefs

## Your North Star (from CSOT)
Return to stable tech income via returner / train-to-hire pathways and bridge roles into automation/data/engineering.
