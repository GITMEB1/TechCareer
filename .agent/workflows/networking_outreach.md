# Workflow: Networking Outreach

This workflow generates tailored outreach messages for recruiters, hiring managers, or peers.

## Inputs
- **Target Profile**: LinkedIn URL or Name/Role of the person.
- **Context**: The specific opportunity or general inquiry topic.
- **SSOT**: Danny's "Positioning Statement".

## 1. Strategy Selection
Choose the outreach type:
1.  **Direct Application Follow-up**: "I've just applied..."
2.  **Referral Request**: "I noticed you work at..."
3.  **General Connection**: "Fellow implementation specialist..."

## 2. Drafting (Agency Rules)
- **Rule 1**: No fluff. Get to the point in line 1.
- **Rule 2**: Use "Evidence-Safe" claims only.
- **Rule 3**: Include a specific "Hook" based on the target's profile or company news.

## 3. Output Variants
Generate 3 variants for the user to choose from:
- **Variant A (Short)**: <300 chars (Connect note style).
- **Variant B (Standard)**: 3-4 sentences (InMail style).
- **Variant C (Warm/Contextual)**: Highlights a shared interest or specific detail.

## 4. Logging
- Log the outreach in `tracking/opportunities.yaml` under the relevant opportunity (if applicable) or a separate "Networking" log.
