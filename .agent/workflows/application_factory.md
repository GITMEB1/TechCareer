# Workflow: Application Factory (v2.0)

This workflow generates the core application assets for a specific job target.

## Inputs Required (Non-negotiable)
- **Target Opportunity**: A specific role from `tracking/opportunities.yaml` or a URL.
- **SSOT**: `SSOT.md` (read-only source of facts).
- **Opportunity Intel**: `opportunity_intel.yaml` generated by the `Opportunity Intelligence` prompt. (MANDATORY).

## 1. Setup
- Create a new directory in `applications/`: `YYYY-MM-DD-CompanyName`.
- Create an `evidence_check.md` file in that folder to log verification.
- Create a `language_gate.md` file in that folder to log banned phrase scans.

## 2. Intelligence Phase (Pre-requisite)
- Run the **Opportunity Intelligence Agent** prompt against the JD.
- Save the output as `applications/YYYY-MM-DD-CompanyName/opportunity_intel.yaml`.
- **Validation**: Ensure the YAML matches `schemas/opportunity_intel.yaml`.

## 3. Analysis & Strategy
- Analyze the Job Description (JD) against `SSOT.md`.
- Read `opportunity_intel.yaml` to extract the `framing_strategy` and `risk_profile`.
- Map key requirements to **Verified Skills** using SSOT evidence only.

## 4. Draft Artifacts
- **CV Bullets (`cv_bullets.md`)**: Tailor strictly based on `SSOT.md` evidence. Use "AI-Accelerated" framing where appropriate.
- **Cover Letter (`cover_letter.md`)**: Draft a narrative connecting Danny's "North Star" to the role, using the `tone_directive` from the Intel file.
- **Claims Table (`claims_table.md`)**: A table mapping every claim in the CV/CL to a specific proof point in `SSOT.md`.

## 5. Language Risk Gate (MANDATORY)
- Scan all drafted artifacts for banned patterns (from SSOT policy):
    - Absolutes: "100%", "zero-defect", "guaranteed".
    - Hype: "2x/10x faster", "orchestrated agents".
- **Action**: Log every hit in `language_gate.md` and rewrite using SSOT-approved alternatives.
- **Blocker**: If a banned term remains and cannot be rewritten verified, DELETE the claim.

## 6. Review Request
- User must review the `claims_table.md` and `language_gate.md`.
- **Rule**: If a claim is marked "Unverified" or a banned term exists, the user must approve the fix/removal.

## 7. Final Compilation
- Once approved, compile the final CV/CL (if applicable, or output text for form submission).
