description: Generate tailored application artifacts (CV, Cover Letter) for a specific opportunity — evidence-safe and credibility-optimised.
version: 2.0

# Workflow: Application Factory (v2.0)

## Inputs Required (Non-negotiable)
- **Target Opportunity**: YAML entry from `tracking/opportunities.yaml` OR JD text + URL.
- **SSOT**: `SSOT.md` (read-only facts, policies, approved phrasing).
- **Opportunity Intel**: `opportunity_intel.yaml` generated by `prompts/opportunity_intel.md`.

**If Opportunity Intel is missing: STOP.**  
Output: “Missing opportunity_intel.yaml — run Intel phase first.”

---

## 1) Setup
- Create `applications/YYYY-MM-DD-CompanyName/`
- Create:
  - `evidence_check.md` (log claims + evidence links/paths)
  - `language_gate.md` (log banned-phrase scans + fixes applied)

---

## 2) Analysis (JD → Pain → Evidence)
- Read JD and extract:
  - top 5 requirements (must-haves)
  - top 3 pain signals (what is expensive/slow/risky)
  - tone/culture signals (documentation, ownership, speed vs stability)
- Read `opportunity_intel.yaml` and adopt its:
  - framing_strategy (emphasise/downplay/avoid)
  - AI narrative calibration
  - implied seniority expectation

**Rule:** Do not “keyword map” only. Always map *capability → pain point* using SSOT.

---

## 3) Draft Artifacts (Evidence-safe)

### 3.1 CV Bullets (`cv_bullets.md`)
- Select 3–6 bullets grounded in SSOT.
- Rewrite using the JD language *only where accurate*.
- Every bullet must pass the “So What?” test:

**Bullet syntax (preferred):**
- “[Business outcome] by [action] using [tool/skill] (evidence: [SSOT ref])”

**Forbidden:**
- Absolutes (100%, zero-defect, guaranteed, never breaks)
- Multipliers (2x/3x/10x faster)
- Undefined engineering terms (self-healing, strictly typed, orchestrated agents)

If you want to imply robustness, you must specify mechanism:
- “retries + error handling + logging + validation” (only if supported by SSOT language)

### 3.2 Cover Letter (`cover_letter.md`)
**Do NOT connect to Danny’s “North Star.”** That is internal motivation, not employer value.

Use this structure:
1) **Hook (1–2 lines):** Who + what role + what you specialise in now.
2) **Company Fit (2–4 lines):** Why this company/team (based on Intel signals).
3) **Value Bridge (3 bullets max):** “Because I have done X, I can reduce Y risk / deliver Z outcome.”
4) **AI Narrative (1–2 lines):** “AI assists boilerplate; I own verification and delivery risk.” (SSOT-approved phrasing only)
5) **Close:** Confident and polite.

### 3.3 Claims Table (`claims_table.md`) — Non-circular
Every claim must include *evidence type*:

Statuses:
- **VERIFIED (External Proof)**: include URL or file path (repo, screenshot, ticket export)
- **SUPPORTED (SSOT)**: grounded in SSOT role/project description but no external proof yet
- **UNVERIFIED (Remove)**: delete from CV/CL

Columns:
- Claim Made
- Status
- Evidence (URL / file path / SSOT section)
- Notes / rewrite if needed

---

## 4) Language Risk Gate (MANDATORY) — before user review
Scan all artifacts for banned patterns (from SSOT policy):
- 100%, zero-defect, guaranteed, never breaks, perfect
- 2x/3x/10x faster
- self-healing, strictly typed, orchestrated agents, intelligence engine

For each hit:
- log in `language_gate.md`
- replace with SSOT-approved alternatives
- if a claim cannot be rewritten safely, remove it

---

## 5) Review Request (User Gate)
User reviews:
- `claims_table.md` (anything UNVERIFIED must be removed)
- tone: consultancy-ready, collaborative, non-defensive
- `language_gate.md` confirms no banned terms remain

---

## 6) Final Compilation
- Produce final polished `cv_final.md` and `cover_letter_final.md` (optional)
- Update `evidence_check.md` with any new proof links/paths gathered during review
