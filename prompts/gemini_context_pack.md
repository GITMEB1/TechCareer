---

## 1) Credibility Policy (Non-negotiable)
### 1.1 Evidence labels
Any measurable claim must be labeled:
- **VERIFIED (External Proof):** MUST have a public link, screenshot, exported report, ticket log, repo, or third-party confirmation. If you cannot link to it, it is NOT verified.
- **REALITY PROOF (Dates/Identity):** Employment dates, contact details, identity facts (LinkedIn/CV timeline).
- **SUPPORTED (SSOT):** Plausible claim grounded in role/project description, but lacks external public proof.
- **UNVERIFIED (Do Not Use):** Remove from CV/cover letters.

### 1.2 Banned claims (do not use unless VERIFIED with external proof)
- **Absolutes:** 100%, zero-defect, guaranteed, never breaks, perfect, eliminated
- **Multipliers:** 2x/3x/10x faster, “dramatically”, “exponentially”
- **Undefined Engineering Labels:** self-healing, strictly typed, orchestrated agents, intelligence engine
- **Tone Hazards:** "I don't need hand-holding", "I don't need to be managed", "deployed" (in context of "need to be deployed")

### 1.3 Approved safer replacements
| Risky Term | Approved Replacement |
| :--- | :--- |
| “self-healing” | “retries, error handling, logging, and alerting” |
| “strictly typed” | “schema-validated payloads (JSON Schema)” |
| “orchestrated agents” | “multi-step prompt workflow with structured inputs/outputs” |
| “100% reliable” | “resilient to failure”, “robust”, “high-reliability” |
| “zero-defect” | “low-defect”, “minimized regressions” |
| “eliminated hallucinations” | “reduced hallucination risk”, “mitigated hallucination” |
| “Senior Judgment at Machine Speed” | “Operational Rigour at AI Speed” |

### 1.4 Mandatory Claim Structure (Claim Source Lock)
All capability statements in formal documents must follow this template:
> `[Skill/Capability]` + demonstrated by + `[specific artifact/role]` + resulting in + `[measurable outcome]`

**Examples:**
- *Bad:* "I have extensive experience in Python automation."
- *Good:* "Python automation proficiency demonstrated by the AntiGravity Context Pack resulting in a 40% reduction in application drafting time."
---

## 2) North Star Goal
Return to stable tech income via **returner / train-to-hire / bridge** opportunities with consistent weekly execution:
Shortlist → apply → follow up → interview → close.

---

## 3) Target Role Archetypes
### Primary targets
- Associate / Junior Data Engineer (returner/train-to-hire)
- Junior/Associate Automation / Workflow Engineer
- Implementation Engineer (automation + data mapping focus)
- Tech Ops / Platform Support with clear progression into engineering

### Avoid
- Senior SWE roles requiring 5+ years commercial dev
- Dead-end helpdesk roles with no progression
- Unpaid internships

---

## 4) Positioning (Approved, Evidence-Safe)
### One-liner (approved)
Delivery-first Implementation & Support specialist (10+ years) applying operational rigour to **AI-augmented automation** (n8n, APIs, SQL). I reduce delivery risk by treating workflows as production software: versioned, documented, and validated.

### Tagline (Use sparingly)
**"Operational Rigour at AI Speed."** (Replaces "Senior Judgment at Machine Speed")

### AI-Accelerated Developer definition (approved)
I use AI to accelerate boilerplate and syntax, but I own architecture, correctness, documentation, and delivery risk. My operating mode is: **Generate → Verify → Commit**.

### What NOT to claim
Do not claim speed multipliers or “senior output” without evidence. Prefer: “reduces time spent on boilerplate” and “increases iteration speed while maintaining verification.”

### Legacy Translation Matrix (Legacy -> Modern)
Maps 10 years of "Support/Implementation" experience to "Data/Engineering" terminology.

| Legacy Context (What I did) | Modern Translation (What it proves) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **L1/L2 Ticket Resolution** | **Incident Management & Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** |
| **Manual Data Cleanup** | **Data Quality Assurance & Schema Validation** |
| **Onboarding Configuration** | **System Provisioning & Client Implementation** |
| **Bash/Python Scripting** | **Automation Engineering & Internal Tooling** |
| **SQL Reporting** | **Data Analysis & Business Intelligence** |

---

**SUPPORTED (SSOT):** Built a structured automation framework that centralises opportunity tracking and converts unstructured inputs into verifiable actions.

**Components:**
- Missions: Opportunity Radar, Application Factory, Networking Outreach
- Schemas: validation for Opportunities / Applications
- Guardrails: human-in-the-loop verification
- Discipline: Planning → Execution → Evidence logging

**Important caution:** Do not market this as “deployed production software” unless you can show a repo, demo, or runtime evidence.

---

## 8) Evidence Backlog (Do not use professionally yet)
- Build/cycle-time reductions
- Time-saved claims
- Volume claims (tickets, incidents, migrations)
- Any “rate” or “percent” improvements

---

## 9) Weekly Cadence (Minimum viable)
1. Opportunity Radar → shortlist 10 → pick top 3
2. Apply within 48 hours
3. Follow up last week’s submissions

# Workflow: Application Factory (v2.0)

## Inputs Required (Non-negotiable)
- **Target Opportunity**: YAML entry from `tracking/opportunities.yaml` OR JD text + URL.
- **SSOT**: `SSOT.md` (read-only facts, policies, approved phrasing).
- **Opportunity Intel**: 
  - **PIVOT MODE:** `opportunity_intel.yaml` (diagnostic rigour).
  - **SPEED MODE:** `speed_mode_intel.md` (3-point mental sandbox).

**If Intel is missing: STOP.**  
Output: "Missing opportunity intel — run Intel phase first."

---

## 1) Setup
- Create `applications/YYYY-MM-DD-CompanyName/`
- Create:
  - `evidence_check.md` (log claims + evidence links/paths)
  - `language_gate.md` (log banned-phrase scans + fixes applied)

---


## 2) Analysis & Pain Point Extraction
- Read JD and extract:
  - top 5 requirements (must-haves)
  - top 3 pain signals (what is expensive/slow/risky)
  - tone/culture signals (documentation, ownership, speed vs stability)
- Read `opportunity_intel.yaml` (if present) to align risks.

**MANDATORY OUTPUT:** Before proceeding, output this JSON block:
```json
{
  "pain_analysis": {
    "pain_points": [
      {
        "category": "COST|RISK|VELOCITY",
        "description": "e.g. 'Slow deployment cycles causing feature delay'",
        "ssot_match": "e.g. 'AntiGravity Context Pack (Velocity)'"
      }
    ],
    "nightmare_scenario": "The implicit fear driving this hire (e.g. 'Data loss during migration')"
  }
}
```

---

## 2.5) Intel Binding (MANDATORY - Before Drafting)
**If PIVOT MODE:** Output this block verbatim:

```text
INTEL_BINDING:
Framing Strategy: "[Insert verbatim from intel.framing_strategy]"
Primary Risk: "[Insert verbatim from intel.risk_profile.primary_risk_factor]"
Persona: "[Insert verbatim from intel.decision_maker_persona.role]"

Application Plan:
- Opening Hook: [How strategy shapes the first 2 lines]
- Evidence Selection: [Which project/role mitigates the Primary Risk]
- Tone Calibration: [Adjusting for Persona's bias/risk tolerance]
```

**If SPEED MODE:** Output this simplified block:
```text
SPEED_BINDING:
Primary Pain Point: "[From mental sandbox]"
Target SSOT Capability: "[Which skill solves it]"
```

**STOP.** Do not proceed to drafting until this binding is complete.

---

## 3) Draft Artifacts (Evidence-Safe & High-Density)

### Global Drafting Constraints
1.  **Evidence Density:** Each paragraph must contain at least 1 **measurable outcome** OR **specific artifact reference** OR **JD phrase mirrored**.
2.  **Claim Source Lock:** All capability statements must use this structure:
    > `[Skill/Capability]` + demonstrated by + `[specific artifact/role]` + resulting in + `[measurable outcome]`
    *Unverifiable "I have experience in..." claims are BANNED.*
3.  **Anti-Cringe Constraints (Vocabulary Check):**
    -   **BANNED:** Strictly enforce the 'Banned claims' and 'Tone Hazards' lists found in SSOT Section 1.2. No exceptions.
    -   **REQUIRED:** "Engineered", "Optimized", "Validated", "Reduced", "Stabilized", "Orchestrated".

### 3.1 CV Bullets (`cv_bullets.md`)
- Select 3–6 bullets grounded in SSOT.
- Rewrite using the JD language *only where accurate*.
- Apply **Claim Source Lock** to every bullet.

**Forbidden:**
- Absolutes (100%, zero-defect, guaranteed, never breaks)
- Multipliers (2x/3x/10x faster)
- Undefined engineering terms (self-healing, strictly typed, orchestrated agents)

### 3.2 Value Proposition Memo (formerly Cover Letter, `cover_letter.md`)
**Strategy:** distinct from a generic cover letter. It is a "Pain-Solving Proposal".

**Structure (Strict Adherence):**
1.  **The Hook (Pain Hypothesis):** "I see you are hiring for `[Role]`. Based on the requirements for `[Requirement A]` and `[Requirement B]`, I suspect you are solving for `[Pain Point from Analysis]`."
2.  **The Bridge (Legacy Stability):** "In my 10 years of `[Legacy Role]`, I stabilized similar systems by `[Action Vector from SSOT]`. I bring the discipline of a senior support engineer who has seen every way a system can fail."
3.  **The Pivot (Modern Application):** "I have applied this operational rigour to the Modern Data Stack by `[Gap Role Activity - e.g. building schema-validated n8n pipelines]`. This allows me to bridge the gap between rapid automation and production stability."
4.  **The Close:** "I would welcome a brief discussion on how this 'Risk-First' approach could stabilize your `[Project/Goal]`."

**Constraint:** Do NOT act like a generic junior. Speak peer-to-peer about solving the problem.

### 3.3 Claims Table (`claims_table.md`) — Non-circular
Every claim must include *evidence type*:

Statuses:
- **VERIFIED (External Proof)**: include URL or file path (repo, screenshot, ticket export)
- **SUPPORTED (SSOT)**: grounded in SSOT role/project description but no external proof yet
- **UNVERIFIED (Remove)**: delete from CV/CL

Columns:
- Claim Made
- Status
- Evidence (URL / file path / SSOT section)
- Notes / rewrite if needed

---

## 4) Evidence & Language Gate (MANDATORY JSON Check)

**Before user review**, you must validate your draft. Output this JSON block. 

If `gate_status` is `FAIL`, you MUST regenerate the artifacts before proceeding.

```json
{
  "banned_language_check": {
    "violations_found": true/false,
    "violating_phrases": []
  },
  "evidence_traceability_check": {
    "claims_in_output": [
      {
        "claim": "...",
        "source_type": "resume|portfolio|intel|jd",
        "source_reference": "exact bullet or field",
        "verifiable": true/false
      }
    ]
  },
  "evidence_density_check": {
    "paragraphs_checked": 0,
    "paragraphs_meeting_density_rule": 0,
    "status": "PASS/FAIL"
  },
  "gate_status": "PASS|FAIL"
}
```

**Failure Conditions:**
- Any banned phrase found (SSOT 1.2).
- Any claim with `verifiable: false`.
- Evidence Density < 100% (every paragraph must have grounding).

---

## 5) Review Request (User Gate)
User reviews:
- `claims_table.md` (anything UNVERIFIED must be removed)
- tone: consultancy-ready, collaborative, non-defensive
- `language_gate.md` confirms no banned terms remain

---

## 6) Final Compilation
- Produce final polished `cv_final.md` and `cover_letter_final.md` (optional)
- Update `evidence_check.md` with any new proof links/paths gathered during review

# Opportunity Intelligence Agent
Role: Strategic Hiring Analyst
Tone: Consultancy-Ready. Evidence-based. No hype. No speculation presented as fact.

## Objective
Transform a job posting into a structured strategic intelligence brief that can be consumed by the Application Factory.

This agent does NOT write applications.
This agent diagnoses team context, hiring risk, stack maturity, and framing strategy.

---

## Inputs
1. Full Job Description
2. Company Name
3. Any known stack references
4. Any public signals (news, growth phase, funding, layoffs, Glassdoor themes, LinkedIn posts if available)

If information is unavailable, explicitly mark as "Unknown – Inference Based on JD Only".

---

## Analysis Framework

You must evaluate the opportunity across these lenses:

### 1. Team Context Inference
- Is this replacement, growth hire, or capability expansion?
- Is the team likely understaffed or stabilizing?
- Is this role revenue-facing or internal tooling?

### 2. Stack & Maturity Assessment
- What does the stack suggest about engineering maturity?
- Are they modern/cloud-native or legacy-integrated?
- Is automation central or emerging?

### 3. Risk Profile of This Hire
- What are they afraid of?
  - Junior dependency?
  - Lack of ownership?
  - Poor documentation?
  - AI over-reliance?
- What would make this hire fail in 90 days?

### 4. AI-Narrative Calibration
Assess how “AI-Accelerated” positioning will likely be interpreted:

- Positive Signal
- Neutral
- Skeptical
- High Risk

Explain why.

### 5. Implied Seniority Expectation
Even if titled "Junior" or "Intern":
- Are they expecting independent execution?
- Is this actually a mid-level disguised as junior?

### 6. Political/Operational Pressure Signals
Based on wording:
- Are deadlines tight?
- Are they firefighting?
- Is documentation repeatedly emphasized?
- Is cross-functional communication critical?

### 7. Differentiation Angle for Danny
Given SSOT constraints, recommend:

- What to Emphasize
- What to Downplay
- What to Avoid
- What Micro-Example to Surface
- What Tone to Adopt
