# Cover Letter - UBDS Associate Data Engineer

**To the Hiring Manager at UBDS Group,**

The consultancy environment demands both technical agility and the ability to deliver client value under pressure. As an experienced Implementation & Support Specialist pivoting into Data Engineering, I offer a rare combination: the hunger of an Associate regarding new tech stacks, backed by 10 years of "battle-tested" operational rigour.

At Cloud Commerce Group and 360insights, I didn't just support software; I owned client outcomes. I stabilized high-volume systems during peak trading, diagnosed complex API integration failures, and managed rigorous data migrations. I learned quickly that code is only as good as the problem it solves for the client.

Recently, I have formalized my move into modern data engineering by building the "AntiGravity Context Pack," a structured automation framework. This project demonstrates my ability to apply Python, JSON schemas, and API integrations to build reliable, auditable workflows—skills directly transferable to the modern data solutions UBDS delivers.

I am excited by UBDS's focus on modernization and cloud transformation. I bring the discipline of a veteran troubleshooter with the fresh perspective of a modern data practitioner. I am ready to learn fast, deliver quality, and support your clients' success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Danny Jackson
