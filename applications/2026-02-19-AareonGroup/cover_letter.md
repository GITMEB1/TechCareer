# Value Proposition: Senior Technical Support Specialist

**To the Aareon Group Hiring Team,**

I see you are looking for a **Senior Technical Support Specialist** to act as a Subject Matter Expert and bridge the gap between Support, Product, and Development. Based on the emphasis on "leading by example" and "process improvement," I suspect you are solving for **Knowledge Silos** and the operational cost of recurring, complex escalations.

In my 10 years at **Cloud Commerce Group (formerly ChannelGrabber)**, I stabilized similar high-volume SaaS retail systems. I progressed from L1 Support to Implementation Lead by treating support not just as "ticket closing," but as **Incident Management**. I diagnosed recurring inventory sync failures, authored the operational runbooks that empowered the wider team, and personally handled the complex SQL-based data fixes that kept clients online during peak trading. I bring the discipline of a senior specialist who has worked across the full spectrum of production support failure modes.

I have recently applied this operational rigour to the **Modern Data Stack** (Python, APIs, Schema Validation). While my core expertise is stable, high-touch support, I now use these modern tools to diagnose issues faster and validate fixes with strict acceptance criteria before they reach a customer. This allows me to bridge the gap between rapid development cycles and the production stability required in Real Estate software.

I would welcome a brief discussion on how this "Risk-First" approach could help stabilize your support operations and reduce the burden on your engineering team.
