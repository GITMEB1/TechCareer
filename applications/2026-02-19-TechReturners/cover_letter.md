# Cover Letter: Tech Returners

**To:** The Tech Returners / Northcoders Talent Team
**Role:** Associate Data Engineer (Returner)

**Subject:** Offering 10 Years of Operational Rigour + Fresh Data Engineering Skills

Dear Talent Team,

I am writing to apply for the Associate Data Engineer stream because my career trajectory closely matches the outcome you deliver: **Senior professional maturity combined with modern technical capability.**

For ten years, I worked on the front lines of SaaS implementation and support, effectively functioning as a "Human API" between broken data and client success. I handled the pressure of live enterprise migrations, diagnosed SQL inventory sync failures during Black Friday peaks, and led onboarding projects where data integrity and uptime were non-negotiable. That experience gave me a deep understanding of what production systems demand.

However, I realized that to deliver higher value, I needed to respect the craft of engineering.

In November 2023, I made the strategic decision to take a dedicated career break to modernise my skillset. This was not a pause, but a structured pivot — treating my learning like a full-time job, I have:
- Built a personal "AntiGravity" automation framework using **YAML schemas** and **prompt engineering** to enforce governance on automated outputs.
- Developed **Python** scripts to parse and validate unstructured data.
- Deepened my **SQL** knowledge from "fixing tickets" to understanding schema design and data modeling.

I am looking for the technical acceleration to translate my decade of operational reliability into code. The "Counter" consultancy model appeals to me because it values reliable delivery. I am ready to bring that operational discipline to your partner clients, backed by the solid engineering foundations your program provides.

Thank you for your time and the mission you serve.

Sincerely,

Danny Jackson
