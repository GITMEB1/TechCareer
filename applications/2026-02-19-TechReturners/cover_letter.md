# Cover Letter: Tech Returners

**To:** The Tech Returners / Northcoders Talent Team
**Role:** Associate Data Engineer (Returner)

**Subject:** Offering 10 Years of Operational Rigour + Fresh Data Engineering Skills

Dear Talent Team,

I am writing to apply for the Associate Data Engineer stream because my career trajectory perfectly aligns with the outcome you deliver: **Senior professional maturity combined with modern technical capability.**

For ten years, I worked on the front lines of SaaS implementation and support, effectively functioning as a "Human API" between broken data and client success. I handled the pressure of live enterprise migrations, debugged SQL inventory syncs during Black Friday peaks, and led onboarding projects where failure was not an option. I know what "production" feels like.

However, I realized that to deliver higher value, I needed to respect the craft of engineering.

In November 2023, I made the strategic decision to take a dedicated career break to "re-platform" my skillset. This was not a pause, but a pivot. treating my learning like a full-time job, I have:
- Built a personal "AntiGravity" automation framework using **YAML schemas** and **prompt engineering** to verify agency outputs.
- Developed **Python** scripts to parse and validate unstructured data.
- Deepened my **SQL** knowledge from "fixing tickets" to understanding schema design and data modeling.

I am not looking for a "junior" start where I need to be taught how to be an employee. I am looking for the technical acceleration to translate my decade of operational reliability into code.

The "Counter" consultancy model appeals to me because it values reliable delivery. I am ready to bring my "Safe Pair of Hands" reputation to your partner clients, backed by the solid engineering foundations your program provides.

Thank you for your time and the mission you serve.

Sincerely,

Danny Jackson
