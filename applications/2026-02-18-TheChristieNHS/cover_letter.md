# Cover Letter - NHS Data Engineer

**To the Hiring Manager at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust,**

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Engineer position. As an Implementation & Support Specialist with over 10 years of experience ensuring system stability and data integrity, I am pivoting formally into Data Engineering to apply that same operational rigour to modern healthcare data pipelines.

My career has been defined by being a "safe pair of hands" for critical systems. At Cloud Commerce Group, I stabilized high-volume retail inventory systems, often executing complex SQL-based data fixes during peak trading periods. I understand that in a clinical environment, accuracy and governance are not optional—they are the baseline.

Recently, during my sabbatical as an Independent Data Engineering Fellow, I have designed and built the "AntiGravity Context Pack," a structured automation framework. This project demonstrates my ability to move beyond ad-hoc scripting to building verified, schema-validated workflows using Python and JSON. I am eager to bring this blend of legacy system discipline and modern automation capability to your team's modernisation program.

I am not looking to "move fast and break things." I am looking to build reliable, auditable, and maintainable data solutions that support The Christie’s critical work.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Danny Jackson
