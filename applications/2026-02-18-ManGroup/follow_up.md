**Subject:** Candidate Query: Returner Programme 2026 (Danny Jackson)

Dear Man Group Talent Team,

I recently submitted my application for the **2026 Returner Programme**.

As an experienced implementation specialist (10+ years) returning from a >2 year career break, I wanted to reiterate my strong interest in the programme. During my time away, I have focused heavily on retraining in modern data workflows and automation, and I am eager to bring this renewed technical focus to a world-class engineering culture.

Thank you for your time and for offering such a valuable pathway for returners.

Best regards,

Danny Jackson
