# Cover Letter: Returner Programme (Man Group)

**To:** The Man Group Returner Programme Team

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the 2026 Returner Programme. After a career break of over two years (since Nov 2023), I am eager to return to a technical environment where I can apply my decade of implementation experience while rapidly upskilling in modern engineering practices.

**Why Man Group?**
I admire Man Group’s reputation for fusing technology with rigour. As someone who spent 9 years ensuring the stability of real-time e-commerce operations, I respect the high-stakes nature of your engineering culture. I am looking for a structured pathway to reintegrate into the workforce, and your programme’s focus on support and mentorship is exactly what I need to translate my past reliability into future contribution.

**The "Retrained" Returner**
During my career break, I have not been idle. I have actively retrained as an "AI-Augmented" operator, treating my home lab as a production environment:
- Building **structured data pipelines** using YAML/JSON schemas.
- Automating workflows with **n8n** and **Python** (augmenting my syntax with AI to move faster).
- Focusing on **documentation** and **verification** as core values.

I bring the professional maturity of a senior hire, ready to integrate into your teams with humility and a hunger to learn.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

**Danny Jackson**
