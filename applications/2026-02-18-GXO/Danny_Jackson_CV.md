## Why GXO & Data Engineering?

Throughout my decade at Cloud Commerce Group, I lived in the data trenches—using SQL to investigate inventory issues and mapping complex datasets for e-commerce clients. I realized that my passion wasn't just fixing issues, but understanding the *pipelines* that caused them. 

As a Middleton local, I bring:
- **Technical Maturity:** A decade of delivery experience with APIs, SQL, and client requirements
- **Modern Acceleration:** Recent retraining as an "AI-Accelerated" technical operator
- **Local Commitment:** Specific reliability regarding commute and long-term commitment to the M24 site

I understand that apprenticeships are an investment. My background ensures I will hit the ground running with professional conduct and core technical literacy, allowing the training to focus purely on the advanced Data Engineering stack (Python, Azure, Fabric).
