**Subject:** Application: Data Engineer Apprentice (Danny Jackson)

Dear [Hiring Manager Name / "GXO Recruitment Team"],

I recently applied for the **Data Engineer Apprentice (Level 5)** role at the Middleton site.

As a local Middleton resident with over 10 years of technical implementation experience (SQL, Data Mapping), I am looking to pivot my career into Data Engineering. I believe my background offers the reliability of a senior hire combined with the eagerness of an apprentice.

I would value the opportunity to discuss how my "Returner" profile could be a great fit for the team.

Best regards,

Danny Jackson
