# Cover Letter: Data Engineer Apprentice (GXO)

**To:** The GXO Apprenticeship Team / Hiring Manager
**Re:** Application for Data Engineer Apprentice (Level 5) - Middleton

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Engineer Apprentice role at your Middleton site. As a Middleton local (M24) with over 10 years of experience in technical implementation and support, I am looking to pivot my career specifically into Data Engineering.

**Why GXO and Data Engineering?**
Throughout my decade at Cloud Commerce Group, I lived in the data trenches—using SQL to investigate inventory issues and mapping complex datasets for e-commerce clients. I realized that my passion wasn't just fixing issues, but understanding the *pipelines* that caused them. GXO’s scale and logistical complexity represent the ultimate data environment, and I am eager to apply my problem-solving skills to your supply chain challenges.

**What I Bring: Senior Reliability, Apprentice Hunger**
I offer a unique profile:
1.  **Technical Maturity:** I have a decade of experience in delivery, dealing with APIs, SQL/Data Mapping, and client requirements. I know how to be reliable, document my work, and communicate clearly.
2.  **Modern Acceleration:** I have spent my recent career break retraining as an "AI-Accelerated" technical operator, building my own data-driven applications and mastering structured data schemas (YAML/JSON) and automation workflows.
3.  **Local Commitment:** I live in Middleton, ensuring specific reliability regarding the commute and long-term commitment to the site.

**The "Risk-Free" Apprentice**
I understand that apprenticeships are an investment. My background ensures I will hit the ground running with professional conduct and core technical literacy, allowing the training to focus purely on the advanced Data Engineering stack (Python, Azure, Fabric).

I would welcome the chance to discuss how my "Returner" profile could be an asset to the GXO team.

Sincerely,

**Danny Jackson**
Middleton, M24
