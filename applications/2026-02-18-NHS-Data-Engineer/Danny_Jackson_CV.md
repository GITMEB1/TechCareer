## Professional Summary

**Technical Specialist pivoting to Data Engineering (10+ Years Experience).**
I am a career returner seeking to formalize self-taught engineering skills through a Level 5 Apprenticeship. I bring over a decade of operational rigour (Technical Support & Implementation) to the data domain. Unlike a typical fresh graduate, I have extensive experience troubleshooting complex integrations, managing incidents, and documenting root causes. I treat data reliability as a critical safety requirement and am ready to apply my skills in SQL, Python, and Automation to modernise NHS data infrastructure.

## Why The Christie NHS?

I understand that in healthcare, data accuracy isn't just a metric—it's patient safety. I bring the humility of an apprentice with the maturity and reliability of a seasoned professional. I am looking for a long-term home where I can serve the public, master my craft, and contribute to the modernization of critical data systems.
