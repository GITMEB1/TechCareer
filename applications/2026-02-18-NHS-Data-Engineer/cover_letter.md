**Re: Data Engineer Apprentice (Level 5) Application**

To the Hiring Team at The Christie / MFT,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Engineer Apprentice role. As a technical professional with over 10 years of experience in Support and Implementation, I am looking to pivot my career into formal Data Engineering. I see this Level 5 Apprenticeship as the perfect bridge to convert my self-taught skills into a rigorous, professional qualification within a mission-critical environment.

**Why The Christie?**
I understand that in a healthcare setting, data engineering isn't just about moving bytes; it's about accuracy, governance, and ultimately, patient outcomes. My career foundation is built on reliability. For nearly a decade at Cloud Commerce Group, I was the person customers relied on when integrations failed. I learned that "fixing it" isn't enough; you have to understand *why* it failed and prevent it from happening again. I want to bring this "Operational Rigour" mindset to The Christie's data modernization program.

**My Technical Baseline**
I have been aggressively upskilling in modern data stacks:
*   **SQL & Python:** I use these daily to structure and query data.
*   **Automation:** I build workflows (using tools like n8n) to automate repetitive data tasks, always enforcing error handling and logging.
*   **AI-Accelerated Workflow:** I leverage AI tools to accelerate the writing of boilerplate code, allowing me to focus my energy on architecture, logic verification, and data safety.

**Why an Apprenticeship?**
Despite my tenure in tech, I recognize that "Senior Support" is not "Senior Engineer." I have the humility to start at Level 5 to build a rock-solid foundation in proper engineering principles, while having the maturity and soft skills of a seasoned professional. I am ready to learn, easy to manage, and committed to a long-term future in public service.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my blend of experience and eagerness to learn can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,

Danny Jackson
