## Professional Summary

**"Operational Rigour at AI Speed."**
I am a technical specialist with **10 years of operational experience** (Support, Implementation, Incident Management) pivoting to AI Engineering. Rather than building "happy path" demos, I apply enterprise rigor to **n8n** and **AI automation**. I build robust, schema-validated, and version-controlled workflows that are **resilient to failure**. I am seeking to bring this **"Low-Risk, High-Reliability"** approach to Convergent, bridging the gap between rapid AI prototyping and stable delivery.

## Retraining & Projects (The "AI Pivot")

### AntiGravity Context Pack (Portfolio Anchor)
**2025 – Present**
*Strategies: n8n, JSON Schema, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Git*

*   **Ensured pipeline robustness** for a personal recruitment platform by implementing JSON schema validation within n8n workflows to prevent data corruption.
*   **Accelerated development velocity** using Cursor and Claude to scaffold complex Python logic, while enforcing a "verify-first" doctrine that **mitigated hallucination risks** in production code.
*   **System Architecture:** Designed a modular multi-step prompt workflow that ingests unstructured data and converts it into structured briefs, demonstrating component-based logic.

## Professional Experience (The "Reliability" Foundation)

### Implementation Specialist
**360insights** | Jun 2023 – Nov 2023

*   **Delivered low-defect data migrations** for enterprise clients by defining rigid acceptance criteria and validation rules, minimizing post-deployment support tickets.
*   Collaborated with engineering to resolve critical **API integration errors** during live onboarding phases, ensuring data integrity.

### Technical Support & Onboarding Lead
**Cloud Commerce Group** | Jun 2013 – Nov 2022

*   **Reduced recurring incidents for e-commerce clients** by authoring comprehensive operational runbooks, applying 10 years of support discipline to the problem of "brittle systems."
*   Spent 9 years ensuring **operational stability** for high-volume retailers, diagnosing distributed system failures (inventory sync) and implementing SQL-based fixes under pressure.
*   Progressed from L1 Support to Implementation Lead, consistently owning the "Day 2" reality of software delivery.

## Why Convergent?

I work autonomously with transparent reporting; I don't need to be managed, I need to be enabled. I bring the hunger of an intern but the experience of a senior support engineer. I know that code is a liability, and I treat automation as a serious engineering discipline. I am ready to build reliable systems for you from Day 1.
