**Subject:** Re: Application for AI Automation Intern - Danny Jackson (n8n/AI Engineer)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I applied for the **AI Automation Intern** role last week and wanted to briefly reiterate my specific interest in your stack.

As a former Implementation Specialist (10 years exp) who has pivoted to **n8n** and **Agentic Workflows**, I believe I offer a unique "Day 1" value proposition: I don't need to be taught how to work in a professional environment, and I am already building with the tools you use.

I have attached a sample of my recent work (AntiGravity Project) which uses n8n to parse unstructured data into strict YAML schemas—a direct parallel to the work described in your listing.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Danny Jackson
*(Middleton, M24)*
