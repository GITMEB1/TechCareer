# Cover Letter - Convergent

**To:** The Engineering Team at Convergent
**Role:** AI Automation Intern

**Subject:** I am the "Low-Risk" Intern who ships production-grade automation.

I am a technical specialist with **10 years of operational experience** (Support, Implementation, Incident Management) pivoting to AI Engineering. I am applying because Convergent represents the exact intersection of my two operational modes: the **speed** of AI-accelerated build tools and the **rigour** of enterprise reliability.

You likely want an intern who avoids "spaghetti automation"—workflows that work once but result in high-maintenance technical debt.

My value proposition is opposite to that risk. Because I have spent a decade troubleshooting broken systems for e-commerce retailers, I build differently. I treat low-code workflows in **n8n** and **Make** as production software—versioned, error-handled, and schema-validated.

**Why I am the specific fit for this high-velocity team:**

1.  **I Build With Reliability First:** In my recent project (AntiGravity), I didn't just "connect APIs." I architected **n8n** pipelines with strict JSON schemas and error-catching branches. I know that an automation without a fallback is just a future outage.
2.  **I Validate "AI Magic":** I use Cursor and Claude daily to accelerate my boilerplate, but I do not trust them blindly. My operating model is **"Generate -> Verify -> Commit."** I own the code, the AI just types it.
3.  **I Work Autonomously:** I have managed enterprise client migrations and critical incidents independently. I communicate proactively, document my work, and solve problems before they escalate.

I am seeking this internship not to "learn how to work," but to apply my operational maturity to your stack immediately. I can ship reliable, documented automations from Day 1.

I would welcome a short technical chat to walk you through my n8n architecture.

Best,

Danny Jackson
