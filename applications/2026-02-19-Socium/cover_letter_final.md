To the Hiring Team,

I see you are hiring for a Junior Data Engineer. Based on the requirements for Python and SQL, alongside the need to support and maintain Azure pipelines, I suspect you are solving for the risk of a junior hire lacking basic engineering fundamentals or the ability to learn complex platform tooling quickly.

In my 10 years of Technical Support and Implementation Lead roles, I supported complex infrastructure by diagnosing distributed inventory sync failures at Cloud Commerce Group and authoring operational runbooks. I bring the discipline of a senior support engineer who has seen how systems fail in production under pressure.

I have applied this operational rigour to modern data tools by building the AntiGravity Context Pack, a Python automation framework, and executing complex SQL-based data patches to maintain uptime. This allows me to bridge the gap between rapid upskilling in tools like Azure Data Factory and production stability, ensuring I can reliably support your pipelines from day one.

I would welcome a brief discussion on how this 'Risk-First' approach could stabilize your data infrastructure growth.

Sincerely,
Danny Jackson
