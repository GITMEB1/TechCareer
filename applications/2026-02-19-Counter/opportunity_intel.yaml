    maturity_level: "Modern Data Stack (Consultancy-grade)"
    automation_centrality: "High — focus on automated pipelines and ETL"

  risk_profile:
    primary_fear: "Junior engineers breaking client data pipelines or requiring excessive hand-holding."
    90_day_failure_mode: "Inability to reliably validate data transformations or communicate issues clearly to stakeholders."
    ai_narrative_risk: "Neutral to Positive. As a tech-training native company, they likely appreciate AI acceleration if it's coupled with rigorous human verification."

  seniority_expectation:
    real_level: "Associate / Bridge"
    independence_required: "Moderate. Mentorship exists, but expects proactive problem solving and operational discipline."

  political_signals:
    documentation_emphasis: "Likely High (Consulting environment needs clear handover)."
    stakeholder_intensity: "High (Client-facing implications)."
    speed_vs_stability_bias: "Stability bias with a need for scalable speed."

  framing_strategy:
    emphasize:
      - "Operational rigour and structured problem solving learned from 10+ years of Support/Implementation."
      - "The 'Generate -> Verify -> Commit' workflow preventing pipeline errors."
      - "Strong foundation in SQL and Python data validation."
    downplay:
      - "Specific gaps in Databricks/Data Lake specific tooling if not asked."
      - "Legacy ticketing systems (focus instead on the *data* side of those tickets)."
    avoid:
      - "Consultancy-speak ('world-class', 'seamless'). Counter aims for practical competence."
      - "Any unverified claims about data volume."
    micro_example_to_surface: "Stabilizing high-volume inventory syncs (ChannelGrabber) by defining rigid acceptance criteria for data patches."
    tone_directive: "Reliable, disciplined, and focused on risk-mitigated technical delivery. Peer-to-peer respect, not junior pleading."

  confidence_level: "High - Job description aligns perfectly with the North Star pivot strategy."
