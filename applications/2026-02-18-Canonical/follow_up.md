**Subject:** Application Inquiry: Junior Data Engineer (Danny Jackson)

Dear Canonical Recruitment Team,

I recently applied for the **Junior Data Engineer (Remote)** position.

I wanted to briefly reaffirm my interest. My background is in Technical Implementation and Support (10+ years), where I specialized in **reliability** and **runbook creation**. I am looking to bring this operational discipline to your Data Engineering team.

I understand the high bar Canonical sets for its engineers, and I am eager to demonstrate how my "Returner" profile combines the maturity of a veteran with the adaptability of a junior.

Best regards,

Danny Jackson
