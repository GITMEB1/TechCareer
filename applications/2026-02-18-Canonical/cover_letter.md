# Cover Letter: Canonical (Junior Data Engineer)

**To:** The Canonical Hiring Manager
**Role:** Junior Data Engineer (Remote / EMEA)

## The Hook: Senior Judgment at Machine Speed
I am a technical specialist with 10 years of delivery and support experience, returning to engineering to build reliable data infrastructure. I prefer Canonical because your engineering culture prioritizes correctness and open-source rigorousness—values I have championed in "Implementation" roles for a decade.

## The Evidence Bridge: Why My Background Solving Your Pain
I understand that hiring a "Junior" Engineer often comes with a "tax": time spent mentoring on basic operational discipline (git hygiene, production safety, documentation).

**I pay that tax upfront.**

*   **You need Reliability:** Because I have spent 10 years fixing broken implementations for enterprise clients (Cloud Commerce Group), I write code that is defensive by default. I don't just "write features"; I write runbooks.
*   **You need Velocity:** I operate as an **AI-Accelerated Developer**. I use modern tools to scaffold boilerplate (Python/Go) instantly, allowing me to spend my time on *architecture* and *verification*. I bring the output of a mid-level engineer with the humility and hunger of a junior.
*   **You need Linux/Data Fluency:** I have architected n8n workflows to parse complex JSON/SQL payloads, treating automation as production software (versioned, tested, logged).

## The "So What?"
I am not just looking to "learn on the job." I am looking to apply a decade of operational maturity to your data stack immediately. I offer the stability of a veteran hire with the modern toolkit of an AI-native builder.

I look forward to discussing how I can reduce your team's toil.
