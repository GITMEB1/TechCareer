## 1) Credibility Policy (Non-negotiable)
### 1.1 Evidence labels
Any measurable claim must be labeled:
- **VERIFIED (External Proof):** MUST have a public link, screenshot, exported report, ticket log, repo, or third-party confirmation. If you cannot link to it, it is NOT verified.
- **REALITY PROOF (Dates/Identity):** Employment dates, contact details, identity facts (LinkedIn/CV timeline).
- **SUPPORTED (SSOT):** Plausible claim grounded in role/project description, but lacks external public proof.
- **OPERATIONAL_PROOF (Internal Enterprise Specificity):** Internal enterprise work lacking a public link. Valid only when making high-resolution technical specificity claims (incident patterns, troubleshooting sequences, runbook ownership, migration safeguards) and must be anchored to SSOT role/project context.
- **UNVERIFIED (Do Not Use):** Remove from CV/cover letters.

### 1.2 Banned claims (do not use unless VERIFIED with external proof)
- **Absolutes:** 100%, zero-defect, guaranteed, never breaks, perfect, eliminated
- **Multipliers:** 2x/3x/10x faster, “dramatically”, “exponentially”
- **Undefined Engineering Labels:** self-healing, strictly typed, orchestrated agents, intelligence engine
- **Tone Hazards:** "I don't need hand-holding", "I don't need to be managed", "deployed" (in context of "need to be deployed")
- **Soft Absolutes (added 2026-02-19):** "perfectly aligns", "failure was not an option", "every way a system can fail", "absolute stability", "Day 1 impact" (unless evidence-linked)
- **Unsourced Reputation Claims (added 2026-02-19):** "Safe Pair of Hands" (unless externally referenced), any "reputation" claim without a named source
- **Consultancy-Speak (added 2026-02-19):** "world-class", "best-in-class", "proven track record", "trusted advisor", "thought leader", "transformative", "seamlessly", "unparalleled", "robust at scale" (unless evidenced), "mission-critical expert", "end-to-end ownership" (unless evidenced)


### 1.3 Approved safer replacements
| Risky Term | Approved Replacement |
| :--- | :--- |
| “self-healing” | “retries, error handling, logging, and alerting” |
| “strictly typed” | “schema-validated payloads (JSON Schema)” |
| “orchestrated agents” | “multi-step prompt workflow with structured inputs/outputs” |
| “100% reliable” | “resilient to failure”, “robust”, “high-reliability” |
| “zero-defect” | “low-defect”, “minimized regressions” |
| “eliminated hallucinations” | “reduced hallucination risk”, “mitigated hallucination” |
| “Senior Judgment at Machine Speed” | “Operational Rigour at AI Speed” |

### 1.4 Mandatory Claim Structure (Claim Source Lock)
All capability statements in formal documents must follow this template:
> `[Skill/Capability]` + demonstrated by + `[specific artifact/role]` + resulting in + `[measurable outcome]`

**Examples:**
- *Bad:* "I have extensive experience in Python automation."
- *Good:* "Python automation proficiency demonstrated by the AntiGravity Context Pack resulting in a 40% reduction in application drafting time."

## 2) North Star Goal
Return to stable tech income via **returner / train-to-hire / bridge** opportunities with consistent weekly execution:
Shortlist → apply → follow up → interview → close.

---

## 3) Target Role Archetypes
### Primary targets
- Associate / Junior Data Engineer (returner/train-to-hire)
- Junior/Associate Automation / Workflow Engineer
- Implementation Engineer (automation + data mapping focus)
- Tech Ops / Platform Support with clear progression into engineering

### Avoid
- Senior SWE roles requiring 5+ years commercial dev
- Dead-end helpdesk roles with no progression
- Unpaid internships

---

## 4) Positioning (Approved, Evidence-Safe)
### Track Model (Canonical)
- **Velocity Track (Day-1 Legacy Impact):** Position Danny as a senior Support/Implementation specialist focused on operational stability, incident management, client lifecycle reliability, and risk mitigation.
- **Pivot Track (Data Engineering Trajectory):** Position Danny as a bridge candidate translating 10+ years of operational rigour into modern Data/Automation engineering workflows.
- Both tracks are canonically valid goals and may be used based on opportunity logistics and fit.

### One-liner (approved)
Delivery-first Implementation & Support specialist (10+ years) applying operational rigour to **AI-augmented automation** (n8n, APIs, SQL). I reduce delivery risk by treating workflows as production software: versioned, documented, and validated.

### Tagline (Use sparingly)
**"Operational Rigour at AI Speed."** (Replaces "Senior Judgment at Machine Speed")

### AI-Accelerated Developer definition (approved)
I use AI to accelerate boilerplate and syntax, but I own architecture, correctness, documentation, and delivery risk. My operating mode is: **Generate → Verify → Commit**.

### What NOT to claim
Do not claim speed multipliers or “senior output” without evidence. Prefer: “reduces time spent on boilerplate” and “increases iteration speed while maintaining verification.”

### Legacy Translation Matrix (Legacy -> Modern)
Maps 10 years of "Support/Implementation" experience to "Data/Engineering" terminology.

| Legacy Context (What I did) | Modern Translation (What it proves) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **L1/L2 Ticket Resolution** | **Incident Management & Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** |
| **Manual Data Cleanup** | **Data Quality Assurance & Schema Validation** |
| **Onboarding Configuration** | **System Provisioning & Client Implementation** |
| **Bash/Python Scripting** | **Automation Engineering & Internal Tooling** |
| **SQL Reporting** | **Data Analysis & Business Intelligence** |

| Documentation / RCA / runbooks | High | High | AI formats notes; Danny ensures accuracy and operational usefulness. |
| Prompt + Context Engineering | High | Med | Danny defines intent/constraints; AI drafts; Danny tests and reduces drift. |

**SUPPORTED (SSOT):** Built a structured automation framework that centralises opportunity tracking and converts unstructured inputs into verifiable actions.

**Components:**
- Missions: Opportunity Radar, Application Factory, Networking Outreach
- Schemas: validation for Opportunities / Applications
- Guardrails: human-in-the-loop verification
- Discipline: Planning → Execution → Evidence logging

**Important caution:** Do not market this as “deployed production software” unless you can show a repo, demo, or runtime evidence.
